Place your CV/Resume PDF here with the exact filename `Nagaraj_aithal.pdf`.

Path: `assets/files/Nagaraj_aithal.pdf`

If you prefer a different filename, update the `href` of the "Download CV" button in `index.html` (element id: `downloadCv`).

Note: If you open `index.html` locally and do not place the PDF here, the page will attempt to link to the attached file at `d:\others\Nagaraj aithal.pdf` as a fallback (this works only when opening locally and if that file exists at the path).
